# Supply Chain Vulnerability Dashboard Challenge - README

## Challenge Description
The Supply Chain Vulnerability Dashboard challenge focuses on improving the reporting capabilities of BlackDuck Binary Analysis (BDBA) scans. The goal is to create a dashboard using web technologies that can utilize the BDBA REST API to collect scan data and visualize it in a user-friendly manner. The dashboard should provide insights into the health of the software by displaying indicators such as the patching speed of vulnerable third-party software, the number of critical vulnerabilities fixed, and other relevant metrics.

## Access to BDBA Server
For this challenge, you will need to sign in to the QA BDBA server and join a custom group. Please reach out to Raj.Bhuiyan@amd.com for access to the group by writing [BDBA Hackathon Access] in the subject line and list of participants in your group.

## Scans of Open Source Binary
Perform a scan of an open source binary. For this challenge, we have chosen previous versions of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) as the target for the BDBA scans.

## API Key Creation
Create an API key on the BDBA server. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the BDBA REST API.

## Dashboard Creation
Create a dashboard using web technologies of your choice. The dashboard should utilize the BDBA REST API to collect scan data and visualize it. Refer to the [BDBA REST API documentation](http://mkdcvbdbaapq01/help/api/) for more information on how to use the API.

## Visualizations
The dashboard should provide useful visualizations of issues broken down by severity, time to fix (time between discovery and fixing), per scan: number of new issues, number of issues fixed, number of persistent issues.

## Getting Started
To participate in the Supply Chain Vulnerability Dashboard challenge, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the QA BDBA server and join the custom group. Reach out to Raj Bhuiyan for access.
2. Perform a BDBA scan of an open source binary (previous versions of Qt).
3. Create an API key on the BDBA server.
4. Build a web-based dashboard using web technologies of your choice.
5. Implement the functionalities for data collection and visualization using the BDBA REST API.
6. Provide visualizations of issues broken down by severity, time to fix, number of new issues, number of issues fixed, and number of persistent issues.
7. Submit your solution for evaluation.

Good luck with the challenge! We look forward to seeing your innovative Supply Chain Vulnerability Dashboard solution.
