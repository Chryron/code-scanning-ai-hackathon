# CodeQL Detective Challenge - README

## Challenge Description
Welcome to the "CodeQL Detective" challenge! In this exciting challenge, you will dive into the world of code analysis and detective work to identify the commits responsible for introducing new issues in a codebase compared to a baseline.

## Repository Selection
For this challenge, we have chosen the open-source repository [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) as the target for the SAST scans and data collection.

## Scans in SARIF Format
We provide 5 scans in SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) format from five different commits in the "tensorflow" repository. Each scan is associated with a specific commit hash and provides information about the findings in the codebase. Additionally, we provide the FLOC (Finding Level of Confidence) for each scan.

The SARIF files and their corresponding commit hashes and FLOC values are available at https://mkmartifactory.amd.com:443/artifactory/SW-SITARTIFACTS-PROD-LOCAL/prototyping/database-5a7786812dd4-2024-01-11.zip, (see the README.md file in the [resources/codeql_scans](./resources/codeql_scans) folder).

## Problem Statement
You are provided with a codebase that undergoes nightly CodeQL scans, generating reports highlighting multiple issues. The objective is to develop an automated solution that can pinpoint the exact commits responsible for introducing these new issues when compared to a baseline.

Your task is to create a tool or algorithm that can analyze the codebase, scan reports, and identify the specific commits that introduced the new issues. The solution should be efficient, accurate, and scalable to handle large codebases with numerous commits and issues.

## Requirements
1. **Automated Analysis**: Develop a solution that can automatically analyze the codebase and scan reports to identify the commits responsible for introducing new issues.
2. **Baseline Comparison**: The solution should be able to compare the codebase against a baseline to determine the new issues.
3. **Commit Information**: The tool or algorithm should provide clear and concise information about the commits, such as commit hash, author, date, and a brief summary of the changes made.
4. **CodeQL Utilization**: Use the SARIF files generated by CodeQL as the basis for your solution. Use can use the oldest commit hash as your baseline.
5. **Scalability**: The solution should be scalable and capable of handling large codebases with thousands of commits and numerous issues.
6. **User-friendly Interface**: Provide a user-friendly interface or visualization to present the identified commits and their associated information.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Accuracy**: The solution should accurately identify the commits responsible for introducing new issues.
2. **Efficiency**: The solution should be efficient and capable of handling large codebases and numerous commits.
3. **Scalability**: The solution should be scalable and able to handle codebases with thousands of commits and numerous issues.
4. **User Experience**: The solution should provide a user-friendly interface or visualization to present the identified commits and their associated information.
5. **Innovation**: Showcase innovative approaches or techniques to enhance the accuracy or efficiency of your solution.

## Getting Started
To participate in the CodeQL Detective challenge, follow these steps:

1. Access the codebase and the CodeQL scan reports from the [resources](./resources) folder.
2. Develop a tool or algorithm that can analyze the codebase and scan reports to identify the commits responsible for introducing new issues.
3. Implement the functionalities for baseline comparison, commit information retrieval.
4. Can your solution handle large codebases with numerous commits and issues?
5. Design a user-friendly interface or visualization to present the identified commits and their associated information.

Good luck with the challenge! We look forward to seeing your innovative CodeQL Detective solution.
